FROM sales_schema.`sales_data (1)` s
JOIN sales_schema.customers_data c
    ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

---

    SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'Electronics' THEN quantity * price_per_unit ELSE 0 END) AS electronics_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'Furniture' THEN quantity * price_per_unit ELSE 0 END) AS furniture_revenue
FROM sales_schema.`sales_data (1)`;
```

---

### Q17. Find customers who never bought Electronics

    ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE s.category != 'Electronics';

-- Method 2: Customers who never bought Electronics
SELECT 
    c.customer_name
FROM sales_schema.customers_data c
